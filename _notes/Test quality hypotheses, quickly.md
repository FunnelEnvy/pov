The only two elements you can affect are:

- The quality of your hypotheses, and
- How quickly you test them and act on the results

Aim to improve these two elements.

To improve hypotheses:

- [[Talk to your customers]]
- Remember that [[Cosmetic changes don't matter]]
- [[Don't test everything]]
- [[Start with the offer]]
- [[Measure the full sales funnel]]

To improve how quickly you test and act on them:

- [[Decouple experimentation from product development]]
- [[Run only as many variants as the hypothesis requires]]
- [[Focus on systems, not hacks]]
