Minimum detectable effect (MDE) is a statistical characteristic of each experiment you design.

This number indicates the percent change that *must* be caused by one of your variants in order for the experiment to reach a conclusive result.

In general:

- Lower MDE → experiments reach statistical significance faster
- Lower MDE → more experiments yield conclusive results
- Fewer variants → lower MDE
- A higher baseline conversion rate → lower MDE
