There's a non-trivial audience of visitors coming to your site that are further down the funnel, but still need to be engaged digitally before they convert. They're aware of the problem & solution, competitors, and what's being said about you in various "dark social" places.

So make sure you have content on the site that is more than just the superficial top of funnel stuff and gets them the information / trial / whatever they need.

[[Talk to your customers]] to confirm this. And [[If you don't understand your customer's buying process, make that your priority]].
