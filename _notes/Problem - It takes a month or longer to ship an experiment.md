[[Don't test everything]], but you must test. [[If you knew exactly what to do you would just do it (and so would your competitors)]].

But "a test every month or two" is simply too slow to succeed.

Suggetions:

- [[Focus on systems, not hacks]]
- [[Decouple experimentation from product development]]
