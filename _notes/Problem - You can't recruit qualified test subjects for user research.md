There are a few (non-mutually exclusive) possible reasons:

## Your standards are too high
- [[Anyone who can quickly grasp the problem you solve is a qualified test subject]]

## You're not clear on the purpose of your research
- [[User testing is for identifying friction and clarity issues]]
- [[Message testing is for identifying clarity and motivation issues]]
