If it's possible to test a hypothesis with a single variant, don't test additional variants.

Running fewer variants lowers your [[Minimum Detectable Effect]] and simplifies implementation and QA. 

This means you'll run more tests, and more of your tests will yield conclusive results. Which is vital, because [[80% of your ideas won't work]].
